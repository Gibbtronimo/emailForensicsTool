Description:
This tool allows the user to search for keywords in an email dataset (enron database formatted as mbox) through the python library mbox. The program ignores duplicate terms, term order, and is not case sensitive.

How to utilize the tool
1. Download the Enron email data set from https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/. Be sure to get the May 7, 2015 version (the file will be named enron_mail_2015057.tar.gz).
2. Go to https://github.com/lintool/Enron2mbox and follow the instructions to convert the data to the mbox format.
3. Then use the program.
